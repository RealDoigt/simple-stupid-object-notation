## Version Notes
* 1 : As defined here: https://github.com/RealDoigt/simple-stupid-object-notation/blob/sson-1.0/readme.md
* 1.5 : Partial implementation of 2.0; typically, that means the semi-colon was removed from the syntax but the `alias` keyword remains unimplemented.
* 2 : Semi-colon removed from the syntax and the `alias` keyword is implemented
* 3 : Currently WIP even in the reference implementation, this means that the `fusion` and `instance` keywords are implemented.
